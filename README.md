# Hydraulic-Plane-Landing-Gear-Control-System
## Abstract
This project presents the design and simulation of a Hydraulic Plane Landing Gear Control System that incorporates a main pump for regular operations and an emergency pump with a cutoff valve for backup in critical scenarios. The system was modeled and tested in Automation Studio, using a PLC to control hydraulic operations and an HMI for real-time monitoring and manual control. The dual-pump design enhances the reliability and safety of the landing gear system, crucial for aviation applications.

## Introduction
Aircraft landing gear systems are essential for safe takeoff and landing. Hydraulic systems are commonly used due to their ability to generate significant force in a compact design. However, in case of main pump failure, an emergency mechanism is crucial to ensure continued operation.
This project focuses on designing a hydraulic landing gear system that features:
- A main pump for regular operation.
- An emergency pump activated via a cutoff valve when the main pump fails.
The system is controlled by a PLC and monitored through an HMI, ensuring safe and efficient operation.

## Objectives
1. Design a hydraulic system with a dual-pump configuration for enhanced safety.
2. Implement PLC logic for seamless transition between the main and emergency pumps.
3. Develop an HMI for real-time monitoring and manual control.
4. Simulate the system to validate its performance under normal and emergency conditions.
